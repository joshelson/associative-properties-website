# Associative Properties - Website

Modern, responsive website for Associative Properties, built with **Astro** and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:4321
```

### Build & Preview

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📦 Deployment

This site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy
# Check the "Actions" tab in GitHub to monitor deployment
```

### First-Time GitHub Pages Setup

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Pages** in the sidebar
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. The workflow will automatically deploy on the next push

## 📧 Contact Form - IMPORTANT SETUP REQUIRED

The contact form uses **FormSubmit.co** (free service) to send emails directly to your inbox. **No backend server needed!**

### ⚠️ FIRST TIME SETUP (Required)

**The form will NOT work until you complete this one-time setup:**

1. **Fill out the contact form** on your live website (or localhost)
2. **Check the inbox** of `hello@associativeproperties.com`
3. **Click the verification link** in the email from FormSubmit
4. **Done!** All future form submissions will now arrive in your inbox automatically

**Note:** You only need to do this ONCE. After verification, the form will work forever.

### How It Works

- When someone submits the form, FormSubmit sends you an email with all the details
- The email will be formatted as a nice table with: Name, Email, Phone, Service, and Message
- You'll receive emails at: `hello@associativeproperties.com`

### What Happens After Submission?

When a user submits the form:
1. **FormSubmit processes it** and sends you an email
2. **User is redirected back** to your site at `#contact-success`
3. **Thank you message appears** with a checkmark icon
4. **Form is hidden** and replaced with the success message
5. User can click "Send Another Message" to submit again

### Form Features

- **Autocomplete enabled**: Browser will suggest saved name, email, and phone
- **Email validation**: Checks format on blur and before submit
- **Phone formatting**: Auto-formats as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` as you type
- **E.164 conversion**: Phone sent as `+1XXXXXXXXXX` in a hidden field
- **Spam protection**: Honeypot field prevents bot submissions
- **Loading state**: Button shows "Sending..." during submission

### Testing Locally

You can test the form on `http://localhost:4321`:
1. Fill out the form
2. Submit it
3. After FormSubmit verification, you'll be redirected back
4. See the success message appear

**Note:** For local testing, the redirect will go to the production URL. You can change `_next` value to `http://localhost:4321/#contact-success` for local testing.

### Changing the Email Address

To send submissions to a different email:

1. Open `src/components/Contact.astro`
2. Find: `action="https://formsubmit.co/hello@associativeproperties.com"`
3. Replace with your email: `action="https://formsubmit.co/your-email@example.com"`
4. Save and deploy
5. Submit a test form to trigger the verification email for the new address

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear Astro cache
rm -rf .astro dist
npm run build
```

### Form Not Sending Emails

1. Check that you've verified the email with FormSubmit (check inbox/spam)
2. Verify the form action URL is correct in `Contact.astro`
3. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in the browser
4. Check browser console for errors

### Deployment Issues

1. Check the **Actions** tab on GitHub for error logs
2. Verify GitHub Pages is configured to use **GitHub Actions** (not branch)
3. Make sure the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
4. Check that `astro.config.mjs` has the correct `site` URL

### CNAME / Custom Domain

If using a custom domain:
1. Ensure `public/CNAME` contains your domain
2. Configure DNS records with your domain registrar
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

## 📝 Development Notes

### Why Astro?

- **Zero JS by default** - Ships pure HTML/CSS, adds JS only when needed
- **Component islands** - Can use React/Vue/Svelte components if needed
- **Fast builds** - Optimized for static sites
- **Great DX** - Modern developer experience with hot reload
- **Perfect for GitHub Pages** - Generates static HTML, no server needed

### Old Files

The original HTML/CSS/JS files are still in the root directory:
- `index.html` (old)
- `style.css` (old)
- `script.js` (old)

These can be safely deleted after confirming the Astro site works.
